# ENSTP Curriculum and Department Guide

## Section 1: Introduction to ENSTP
The École Nationale Supérieure des Travaux Publics (ENSTP) is one of Algeria’s most prestigious engineering institutions, specializing in civil engineering and public works. Founded in 1966 and located in Kouba, Algiers, ENSTP has played a critical role in training the engineering workforce responsible for Algeria’s infrastructure development. ENSTP is renowned for its rigorous academic programs, combining theoretical knowledge with practical applications.

## Section 2: Departmental Structure at ENSTP
ENSTP’s academic structure features two major departments for specialization in civil engineering:

### 2.1 Département des Matériaux et Structures (DMS)
The Department of Materials and Structures focuses on the analysis, design, and construction of various civil engineering structures, with emphasis on the behavior of materials. The curriculum is centered around structural engineering principles, material science, and advanced analysis techniques.
- **Primary Specialization:** Routes et Ouvrages (Roads and Structures)

### 2.2 Département des Infrastructures de Base (DIB)
The Department of Basic Infrastructure concentrates on the planning, design, and management of civil infrastructure systems, with particular attention to transportation networks, hydraulic systems, and urban development. The department emphasizes systems integration and network optimization.
- **Primary Specialization:** Infrastructures de Base (Basic Infrastructure)

## Section 3: Academic Programs and Degrees
Both DMS and DIB departments offer identical degree designations:
- **Ingénieur d’état en travaux publics (State Engineer in Public Works):** The primary professional degree.
- **Master en travaux publics (Master’s in Public Works):** An advanced degree for specialization or research.
The engineering program typically spans five years. Degrees are recognized by the Algerian Ministry of Higher Education and internationally.
